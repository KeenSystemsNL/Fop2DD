PROJECT AIM
===========
This project aims to create a .Net client library capable of communicating with a FOP2 server. It
provides an event-based library to send/receive messages to/from the FOP2 server. A simple application
demonstrating some of the capabilities is also provided.

The client library is the main focus; this library needs to abstract all the (complicated)
protocol-specific details away and keep required FOP2-specific implementation details to a minimum.
This project is open sourced in the hopes that the OSS community is willing to improve this library
and build great .Net (capable) applications based on this library. The library itself requires the
.Net framework v3.5 at a minimum and the aim is to keep external dependencies to a minimum (currently:
none).
