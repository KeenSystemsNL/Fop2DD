For new releases the following needs to be done/checked:

Work is done on trunk. When a build is deemed ready for release we increase version numbers on the
projects that have been changed since the previous release (see step 1 and 2).

1) Increase versionnumber on Fop2ClientLib?
	If so ->
		Also change version in Fop2Client.shfbproj and recompile helpfile
		Also change version in Fop2Client.nuspec and update releasenotes; build new nupkg and publish nupkg at nuget.org

2) Increase versionnumber on Fop2DDClient?
	If so ->
		Also increase versionnumbers in setup.iss, build new setup executable, publish executable at codeplex

3) When release is published, create a branch in sourcecontrol with the name of the release

4) Continue work on trunk
